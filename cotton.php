<h1>major diseases of cotton and their precautions</h1>

<p><h2>Stamp out disease! What do you need to know?</h2></p>
<p>Developing an Integrated Disease Management strategy for your farm

Effective disease management should be integrated within the management of the whole farm, focusing on the host, the potential pathogen, and the environment. The implementation of basic disease management strategies, even where a significant disease problem is not evident, will reduce the risk of future outbreaks.

It is important be informed about what  diseases are present and where they occur on your farm to implement management strategies which can assist with minimising the severity and spread of diseases. Growers and agronomists can  conduct their own early and late season disease surveys to monitor and record findings allowing comparison over time. Farm staff should be trained to look for and report unusual symptoms in the crop. Contact your state department cotton pathologist for assistance in identifying suspected diseases and to confirm pathogen strain.

Pathoge</p>

<p>Among these, the bollworms viz., American bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, (Hubner), 
spotted bollworm, Earias vittella (Fabricius), spiny bollworm, Earias insulana (Biosdual),
 pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), pose greater threat to cotton production.
 Besides these, a complex of sucking pests viz., green leaf hopper, Amrasca biguttula biguttula
 (Ishida), thrips, Thrips tabaci (Linnman), aphids, Aphis gossypii (Glover), whitefly, Bemisia
 tabaci (Gennadius), red cotton bug, Dysdercus koenigii (Fabricius) and dusky cotton bug, Oxycaranu
 shayalinipennis (Costa) occupy major pest status and contribute to lower yields.</p>

  <strong>symptoms:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>The basal internodes develop soft rot and give a water soaked appearance. A mild sweet fermenting odour accompanies such rotting.</li>
  <li>Leaves some time show signs of wilting or water loss and affected plants within a few days of infection lodge or topple down.</li>
  <li>Ears and shank may also show rot. They fail to develop further and the ears hang down simply from the plant</li>
  </ul>
  
  <strong>control measures:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Use of disease resistance varieties, i.e. Hybrids Ganga Safed-2, DHM 103, show significantly less disease incidence than other hybrids.</li>
  <li>Avoid waterlogging and poor drainage.</li>
  </ul>
